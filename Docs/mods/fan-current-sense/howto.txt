Simple version:
===============

1) Cut a GND trace on the bottom of the board (see images).
2) Place a 1 Ohm resistor (0805 / 1206) across the gap.
3) Connect the high-side of that resistor to PC2 via a 10k resistor.
4) Enable the mod in the .h file.

Measured values:

fan-current at lowest speed:   74mA - ADC: ~30 (Vref = 2.5V)
fan-current at highest speed: 174mA - ADC: ~70
